        <h1>Dhaal Pay - UPI Security & Financial Insights</h1>
        <p>Ensuring secure digital payments and financial health through UPI ID verification and CIBIL score tracking.
        </p>
    </header>

    <section class="overview">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>In the fast-growing digital payment landscape, Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has revolutionized
            transactions in India. However, with its convenience comes a significant challenge‚Äîfraudulent transactions
            and unverified UPI IDs. Users often struggle to determine whether a UPI ID is legitimate, leading to
            security risks and potential financial losses.</p>
        <p>Dhaal Pay is a mobile application designed to address this issue by enabling users to verify UPI IDs before
            making payments. By providing crucial insights like UPI account authenticity, transaction frequency,
            location data, and security status, Dhaal Pay empowers users to make informed decisions while ensuring a
            safer digital transaction experience.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="problem">
        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>With the rise of UPI-based digital payments, fraud cases have also increased significantly. Many users
            unknowingly send money to fraudulent or newly created UPI IDs, leading to financial loss and security
            concerns. The lack of transparency in UPI transactions prevents users from verifying recipient authenticity
            before transferring money.</p>
        <p>Additionally, many individuals struggle with financial health management, often unaware of their CIBIL score
            and creditworthiness. A low CIBIL score can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduce loan and credit card approval chances.</li>
            <li>Increase interest rates on loans.</li>
            <li>Impact financial stability and future borrowing power.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Key Challenges Faced by Users</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>üö® UPI Fraud Risk: Scammers create fake UPI IDs to trick users into transferring money.</li>
            <li>üö® No Verification Mechanism: Users lack a way to check the authenticity of UPI IDs before making
                payments.</li>
            <li>üö® Financial Unawareness: Many users are unaware of their CIBIL score and how to improve it.</li>
            <li>üö® Poor Credit Management: Missing loan or credit card payments negatively affects credit scores, but
                users often don‚Äôt receive proper guidance.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="research">
        <h2>Research & Insights</h2>
        <h3>User Research Approach</h3>
        <p>To build a user-centric solution, we conducted extensive research to understand the challenges people face

        <h3>User Feedback Integration</h3>

        <p><strong>Financial Reminders:</strong> Users requested a payment reminder feature to avoid missed bills and improve their financial discipline. This was incorporated as a high-priority feature.</p>

        <h3>Feature Evolution</h3>
        <p><strong>Initial Concept:</strong> Initially, the app only offered basic UPI payment verification.</p>
        <p><strong>User Feedback:</strong> After conducting user testing, we realized that integrating CIBIL score tracking and financial tips would address broader user needs.</p>
        <p><strong>Final Concept:</strong> The app evolved to include fraud alerts, expense tracking, and personalized financial insights to help users take proactive control of their finances.</p>
